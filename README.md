# Cat-and-Dog-Audio-Classification
Audio Deep Learning Classification of sounds of Cats and Dogs Using CNN
 
## Dataset

The dataset consists in many "wav" files for both the cat and dog classes :
- Cat has 167 WAV files to which corresponds 1323 sec of audio
- Dog has 113 WAV files to which corresponds 598 sec of audio

- A sample auidio file "dog_test.wav" is added to repository used for testing the model.

All the WAV files contains 16KHz audio and have variable length.

## Feature Extraction - MFCC(Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
This feature is one of the most important method to extract a feature of an audio signal and is used majorly whenever working on audio signals.

MFCC Features extracted from the Audio signals:

<p>
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a subtype of Neural Networks that is mainly used for applications in image and speech recognition. Its built-in convolutional layer reduces the high dimensionality of images without losing its information. That is why CNNs are especially suited for this use case.
